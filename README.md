# Tournament-Database
Wrote a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. This was the final project in the Intro to Rational Databases from Udacity.

Files:
Vagrantfile - describes the type of machine required for the project, and how to configure and provision the machine.
pg_config.sh - has the configuration parameters of my currently installed version of PostgreSQL.
tournament.py - contains the python code for my module. The functions names and comments were provided by Udacity, but not the code within the functions.
tournament.sql - contains the schema for my database.
tournament_test.py - provided by Udacity, it contains tests for each function of the tournament.py code, to ensure that each step is executed correctly.
